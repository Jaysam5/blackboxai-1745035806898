# Campus Lost and Found System

## Project Overview
The Campus Lost and Found System is a web application designed to help students, staff, and visitors report and find lost and found items on campus. This system provides a user-friendly interface for users to register, login, and manage their lost or found items through a secure dashboard. Administrators have additional privileges to manage all items and users, aiming to make the campus a safer and more organized place.

## Installation
To set up the Campus Lost and Found System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/campus-lost-and-found.git
   cd campus-lost-and-found
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**
   - Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
   - Create a database named `lost_and_found_system`.
   - Modify the `config.php` file to set your database credentials (username and password).

3. **Import the database schema:**
   You need to create the necessary tables in the database. Execute the SQL commands required to set up your `users` and `items` tables.

4. **Start a local server:**
   You can use PHP's built-in server for testing:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.php`.

## Usage
- **Signup:** New users can create an account by going to the signup page and filling out the form.
- **Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- **Dashboard:** Once logged in, users can report new lost items or found items, view their submitted items, and, if applicable, manage item statuses.
- **Logout:** Users can log out using the provided link in the navigation.
